# addressProject
Download both files to attached, and have the students address 
excel file as well. When running the program make sure the CSV file and
excel file are closed to prevent errors and so file can be written to.
Program can take a few seconds to run, may seem that it is not working at first, once the terminal
shows the python file is closed the program will have finished and you can access the student address file.

EDIT:
Python doesnt have pandas library installed, to do this type in command line: python -m pip install pandas
